# Estimation Report (Directional)
## Metrics
- Control (psa) conversion: 1.79% (420/23524)
- Treatment (ad) conversion: 2.55% (14423/564577)
- Absolute lift (treat - control): 0.77 pp
- Relative lift: 43.09%

## Statistical Inference
- Two-proportion z-test: z = 7.370
- p-value: 1.7053e-13
- 95% CI for lift: [0.60 pp, 0.94 pp]

## Practical Translation
- Incremental conversions per 1,000,000 users exposed ≈ 7,692

## Interpretation (Important)
- The full-dataset estimate is best treated as **directional** unless assignment/comparability is confirmed.
- The allocation pattern is consistent with a **holdout** (treatment-heavy) design; holdouts can be valid for incremental measurement if randomized and stable over time.
